![Ramiel Laser Projector](http://tessasiegel.com/images/581076e8.ramiel2.jpg)

Ramiel is a [laser projector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_projector) powered by a ChromeBox. Using the web app, users can upload or draw images to be sent to the projector and view them via live webcast. The hardware and client Node.js app was handled by me, the website was built by Atilio Barreda and Ethan Cline. Visit the interface [here](http://ramiel.herokuapp.com/).

This repo contains the app that receives and optimizes images, interacts with Jeffrey Nelson's superb [Lasershark board](http://macpod.net/electronics/lasershark/lasershark.php), and runs Héctor Martín Cantero's excellent [OpenLase](https://github.com/marcan/openlase) software. 

Ramiel is currently moving homes! Projection is down for now, but check back on the website soon. If you have any questions about what we did here, feel free to contact me.
